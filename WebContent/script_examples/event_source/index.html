		<h3>About this sample</h3>
		<div>This sample uses jQuery eventing, with bind() and trigger()
			functions. A list of customers is defined in the Customer List
			portlet, and a click event on each customer is used to fire the event
			by calling trigger() with a queue object. In the details portlet, the
			bind() function is called using the same queue object. When the event
			is received, it looks up a customer ID from the customersData array
			and updates the display. This code serves as event source.</div>
