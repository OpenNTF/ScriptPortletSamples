			About this sample</h3>
		<div>
			This sample uses jQuery eventing, with bind() and trigger() functions. A list of customers is
defined in the Customer List portlet, and a click event on each customer is used to fire the
event by calling trigger() with a queue object. In the details portlet, the bind() function is
called using the same queue object. When the event is received, it looks up a customer ID
from the customersData array and updates the display. This code serves as event source.</div>
